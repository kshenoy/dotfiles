# Safer wipes. Using =git reset HEAD --hard= leaves no room for undoing anything.
# This commits everything and then does a hard reset to remove that commit. The nice thing is, the commit is still
# there, but it’s just unreachable. Unreachable commits are a bit inconvenient to restore, but at least they are still
# there. I can run the =git reflog= command and find the SHA of the commit if I realize later that I made a mistake with
# the reset. The commit message will be “WIPE SAVEPOINT” in this case.
