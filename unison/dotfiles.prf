#          When set to true, this flag causes the user interface to skip
#          asking for confirmations on non-conflicting changes. (More
#          precisely, when the user interface is done setting the
#          propagation direction for one entry and is about to move to the
#          next, it will skip over all non-conflicting entries and go
#          directly to the next conflict.)

#          When this is set to true, the user interface will ask no
#          questions at all. Non-conflicting changes will be propagated;
#          conflicts will be skipped.
batch=true

#          !When this is set to true, Unison will request an extra
#          confirmation if it appears that the entire replica has been
#          deleted, before propagating the change. If the batch flag is
#          also set, synchronization will be aborted. When the path
#          preference is used, the same confirmation will be requested for
#          top-level paths. (At the moment, this flag only affects the
#          text user interface.) See also the mountpoint preference.
confirmbigdel=false

#          When this preference is set to true, Unison will use the
#          modification time and length of a file as a `pseudo inode
#          number' when scanning replicas for updates, instead of reading
#          the full contents of every file. Under Windows, this may cause
#          Unison to miss propagating an update if the modification time
#          and length of the file are both unchanged by the update.
#          However, Unison will never overwrite such an update with a
#          change from the other replica, since it always does a safe
#          check for updates just before propagating a change. Thus, it is
#          reasonable to use this switch under Windows most of the time
#          and occasionally run Unison once with fastcheck set to false,
#          if you are worried that Unison may have overlooked an update.
#          The default value of the preference is auto, which causes
#          Unison to use fast checking on Unix replicas (where it is safe)
#          and slow checking on Windows replicas. For backward
#          compatibility, yes, no, and default can be used in place of
#          true, false, and auto. See the section "Fast Checking" for more
#          information.

#          When this flag is set to true, the group attributes of the

group=false

#          When this flag is set to true, the owner attributes of the

#          extttnumerids.

copyonconflict=true

#          Including the preference -prefer root causes Unison always to
#          resolve conflicts in favor of root, rather than asking for
#          guidance from the user. (The syntax of root is the same as for
#          the root preference, plus the special values newer and older.)
